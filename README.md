# Progress-Steps

This is a simple progress bar components.<br/>

We can use button [Prev] and [Next] to control the steps to show the user which steps they are in progressâ€”for example, shopping on line.<br/>

### This side-project has four components:
1. progress - the blue line to extend the width of each step.
2. prev - the button to return the preview step.
3. next - the button to enter the next step.
4. circles - the number of states in progress bar
